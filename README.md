# MinuteMeals---ASP.NET

**MinuteMeals** is an ASP.NET Core MVC web application built as part of a programming assignment.  
The goal of the project is to create a recipe website where users can browse and view quick and easy recipes using an **in-memory database**.  

---

##  Project Description

A client requested a simple recipe website that can display **10 recipes**.  
No advanced recipe management is required â€” only browsing and viewing details.  

The project demonstrates:
- ASP.NET Core MVC fundamentals  
- Entity Framework Core with an **InMemory database**  
- Proper use of **Dependency Injection**  
- Bootstrap styling and responsive design  
- Usage of **Partial Views** for component-based UI  

---

##  Features

### Home Page
- Displays a list of all recipes (at least 10 pre-seeded at startup).  
- Only the **name** and **cooking time** are shown.  
- Each recipe is displayed using a **partial view**.  
- Clicking a recipe navigates to its detail page.  

### Recipe Details
- Shows the recipeâ€™s **name**, **cooking time**, **ingredients**, and **steps**.  
- Uses routing with `asp-route-id` to fetch details dynamically.  
- Includes a link to return to the home page.  

### Recipe Management Page
- Accessible via a separate **"Recipes"** menu option.  
- Displays a **Bootstrap-styled table** with recipe names and cooking times.  
- Each table row is rendered using a **partial view**.
